# Quietfield
## A less distracting Stackfield / Electron app / Chrome extension

[Stackfield](https://www.stackfield.com)© is a great project management app! One of the few really GDPR compliant ones, fully built, maintained and hosted in Germany, Europe.

A downside is the many (WAAAYYYYY TOO MUCH) distracting in-app notifications.

## Electron
*Quietfield* is a simple Electron-Forge configuration which adds some simple CSS to quiet down the multitude of notifications. 
Enabling you to work without being alerted every-single-time a co-worker does anything-at-all-not-related-to-you in a room you are member of.

### Install

Make sure you have installed [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) and [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/).

```
git clone https://github.com/MaartenW/Quietfield.git
cd Quietfield
npm run make
```



## Chrome Extension
*Quietfield* is a simple Chrome extension which adds some simple CSS to quiet down the multitude of notifications. 
Enabling you to work without being alerted every-single-time a co-worker does anything-at-all-not-related-to-you in a room you are member of.
